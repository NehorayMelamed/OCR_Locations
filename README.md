# OCR API Service for Arabic Text Recognition

## Introduction
Welcome to our repository! This project aims to establish a robust API service dedicated to Optical Character Recognition (OCR), with a special focus on Arabic text. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of Google Cloud Vision OCR and a suite of tailored algorithms, we strive to provide an efficient and accurate solution for converting images to machine-encoded Arabic text.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project encompasses the development and deployment of an API service that simplifies the process of OCR, particularly for Arabic script. Given the unique complexities of Arabic text recognition, such as its cursive nature and various calligraphic styles, this service is designed to address and overcome these challenges through the following:

- Integration with Google Cloud Vision OCR: Utilizing Google's state-of-the-art OCR technology to ensure high accuracy in text detection and recognition.
- Custom Algorithms: Implementing specialized algorithms that enhance the text recognition process for Arabic script, improving upon the raw output from Google Cloud Vision OCR.

Our service aims to cater to developers, businesses, and researchers who require a reliable tool for Arabic text digitization embedded within their applications or workflows.

This repository was created in collaboration with [@ori_giladi](https://github.com/search?q=origiladii&type=users), whose contributions have been invaluable in bringing this project to life.

## Getting Started
(Here you can add instructions on how to set up the project, how to use the API, examples of requests and responses, etc.)

We are excited to see how this API service will empower users to seamlessly integrate Arabic OCR capabilities into their applications and contribute to the accessibility and understanding of Arabic textual content.

Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute to the project!
